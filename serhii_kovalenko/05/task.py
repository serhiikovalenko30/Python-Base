# One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead of numbers.
# When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for two numbers.
# Add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number, and print a
# friendly error message. Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.

# creating a variable with a file name
file = 'results.txt'
